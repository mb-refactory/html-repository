    <h1>Delivery</h1>

            <p>
                HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most
                often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.
            </p>
            <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers
                using the <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and
                other
                content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives,
                other information is transmitted along with the document. This meta data usually includes the MIME type
                (e.g., <code>/html</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>) and the character encoding.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is
                initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML;
                syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type
                might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.
            </p>
            <h2>HTML e-mail</h2>
            <p>
                Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting
                and semantic markup not available with plain text. This may include typographic information like colored
                headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a GUI
                editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in
                e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise phishing
                attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse
                spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.
            </p>
            <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
            <p>
                The most common filename extension for files containing HTML is .html. A common abbreviation of this is
                .htm, which originated because some early operating systems and file systems, such as DOS and the
                limitations imposed by FAT data structure, limited file extensions to three letters.
